🚀 Customer Support Guru and Data Explorer

Hey there! 👋 I'm all about solving customer puzzles and diving into data like a pro. Here's a peek into my journey:

Work Highlights:

🎩 Writesonic (Aug '22 - Apr '23): Supervised support tasks, dug into data for insights, and made sure our support ship sailed smoothly.
<br>
🌟 Office24By7 (Mar '21 - Jul '22): Led teams, trained newbies, and cooked up strategies based on customer feedback.
<br>
🔍 Amazon Development Center (Apr '17 - Oct '18): Investigated risks, guided transitions, and kept Amazon's customers safe.
<br>
💻 Dell International (Mar '16 - Mar '17): Fixed tech woes, logged questions, and dispatched the right parts.

Fun Fact: When I'm not sleuthing through data, you'll find me sipping coffee or pondering why the office microwave always smells like burnt popcorn. 🍿☕
